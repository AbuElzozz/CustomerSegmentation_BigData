# Customer Segmentation using Big Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive customer segmentation system using big data technologies to analyze and cluster customers based on their behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns. The solution helps businesses understand their customer base for targeted marketing and personalized services.

## Key Features
- **Scalable big data processing** using PySpark for handling large datasets
- **Advanced clustering algorithms** including K-Means and RFM analysis
- **Interactive visualizations** of customer segments
- **Behavioral analysis** to identify purchasing patterns
- **Demographic profiling** for personalized marketing

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gather customer transaction data
   - Clean and normalize data for analysis

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Calculate Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics
   - Extract behavioral patterns
   - Create demographic profiles

3. **Clustering Implementation**
   - K-Means clustering for segment identification
   - Optimal cluster determination using elbow method
   - Segment profiling and analysis

4. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Segment comparison charts
   - Behavioral pattern visualizations

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark** for distributed data processing
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis

## Dataset
The project uses a comprehensive customer dataset containing:
- Transaction histories
- Demographic information
- Product preferences
- Engagement metrics

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AbuElzozz/CustomerSegmentation_BigData.git
